/*
    Java program to find Given number is perfect square or not using copy constructor

    A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the product of an integer 
    by itself or as the second exponent of an integer. For example, 25 is a perfect square 
    because it is the product of integer 5 by itself, 5 Ã— 5 = 25.

    A copy constructor in a Java class is a constructor that creates an object using another
    object of the same Java class.
